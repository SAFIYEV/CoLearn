## Slide 1: Title

### Slide Content:
**CoLearn**

**Subtitle:** Personalized Learning Paths Powered by AI

**Presented by:**
Marat Safiyev
*Founder & Full-Stack Developer*

Emil Karimov
*Co-founder & Frontend Developer*

**Event:** Hackathon 2026

### Presentation Text:
"Hi, I'm Marat. I'm a solo developer, and I built CoLearn—a platform that solves the biggest problem in online education: lack of personalization."

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

### Slide Content:
**Why do 70% of people quit online courses?**

❌ **One-size-fits-all:** Content is generic, not tailored to you.
❌ **Time Constraints:** 40-hour courses don't fit busy schedules.
❌ **Lack of Context:** Courses ignore your current knowledge level.

**Result:** Wasted money and unfinished learning.

### Presentation Text:
"The problem is simple. Traditional courses are static. They don't care about your deadlines, your goals, or what you already know. That's why 70% of people drop out. They need a personal tutor, not a pre-recorded video."

---

## Slide 3: The Solution

### Slide Content:
**CoLearn: Your AI Personal Tutor**

🎯 **Custom Curriculum:** Generated specifically for your goals.
⚡ **Speed:** Full course created in <30 seconds.
🧩 **Micro-learning:** Structured modules that fit your timeline.
🧠 **Active Learning:** Built-in quizzes and AI assistance.

### Presentation Text:
"CoLearn is the solution. It uses AI to generate a completely unique course for every user. You get a structured education path that fits exactly into your schedule and targets your specific learning goals."

## Slide 4: How It Works

### Slide Content:
**From Idea to Course in 3 Steps**

1.  **Input Goals**
    *   "I want to learn React in 2 weeks for a job interview."
2.  **AI Generation**
    *   System builds modules, lessons, and practical examples.
3.  **Start Learning**
    *   Track progress, take tests, and chat with the AI context-helper.

### Presentation Text:
"It works in three simple steps. One: you tell the app what you want to learn and your deadine. Two: The AI builds a curriculum instantly. Three: You start learning with a platform that adapts to you."

### Presentation Text:
"Inside the course, it's not just text. It offers rich formatting, code examples, and—crucially—an AI assistant that knows the context of the lesson. Stuck? Just ask. It's like raising your hand in class."
